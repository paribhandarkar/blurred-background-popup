# Blurred Background Popup

This is a simple webpage that demonstrates a blurred background popup. The webpage contains a container with a background image and a button that, when clicked, displays a popup window with a blurred background. The popup window prompts the user to enter their email and offers a 20% discount in return. The popup window can be closed by clicking on the 'x' icon or outside the popup window. The webpage is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
